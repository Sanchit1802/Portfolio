            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am passionate about technology, coding, and problem-solving. Since I started my BTech journey, I’ve been learning new concepts and diving deeper into areas like Python, Java, Web Development, and Android Development.</p>
            <p>When I am not coding, you can find me reading books, experimenting with new technologies, or working on personal projects. My goal is to keep enhancing my skills and contribute to projects that can make a difference in people's lives.</p>
            <p>I believe in lifelong learning, and I'm always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and engineer.</p>
